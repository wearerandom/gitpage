Coinhive is shutting down, so we're removing the mining widget at the 'Contribute' section.

Coinhive has been working nicely and has been very loved because they javascript mining scripts, many of them embedded in sites in nasty ways. It's a more profitable movement than a deface, so it's reasonable.

To contribute with us you can send some pennies to our wallets.
