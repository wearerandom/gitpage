<p><a href="https://coinhive.com/">Coinhive</a> brings us an easy way to mine <a href="http://monero.org/">Monero</a> cryptocurrency via a Javascript incrusted in a webpage.

<p>This allows us to earn some money from our visitors without adding any kind of ad. We're against SPAM.

<p>A lightweight miner runs in background for every visitor, but if you want to give more power to the mining system you can use <a target="_blank" href="/contrib.html">our miner</a>.

<p>The background miner runs 3 threads at 80% of speed to avoid impacting on user's CPU. If you experiment any performance issue, please let us know <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/wearerandom/wearerandom.github.io/issues">creating an issue at the repository</a>.

<p>Thanks for your support!
